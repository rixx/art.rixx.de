Postcard for friends.

Not much to optimise, as I drew the snowflake in a single path. I learnt how to handle rotation and clones and repeated
patterns in Inkscape with this, which will come in handy!

The font came out pretty well with the Hershey fonts tool from the Axidraw Inkscape extension, but the optimisation was
iffy in places, and I had to move the letters together â€“ the font is clearly designed to flow from one letter to
another, but the rendering placed them slightly apart.

The Sakura pen is as good as everybody said, I'm very pleased with it.
