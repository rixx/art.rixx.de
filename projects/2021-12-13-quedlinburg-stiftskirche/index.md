Postcard for family.

I spent several hours tracing a [photo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Quedlinburg_asv2018-10_img03_Castle.jpg) for
this – in the end, I only used the church part, due to the size of postcards and my pens, but I hope to finish the
tracing and plot a larger version in the future.

I tried to go with my smallest Sakura Gelly Roll (the 05) first, but it proved unreliable – either I need to get a
better handle on the pressure, or they're just not the greatest for the job. Going up a size to the 08 was enough to get
steady flow and a good result without compromising on the details (though the font came out a bit heavier than I had
planned for). The plot on black paper is the only working one I got with the 05.

I forgot to run vpype optimisations before plotting, but since the plot only consisted of hand-drawn long lines and
Hershey fonts, it came out well regardless, with only minor suboptimal ordering.
