I had one hidden text object and the only way to remove it was to select everythign by drag-selection, cutting it, then
selecting everything left (nothing visible!) with C-a, deleting it, and using paste-in-place to put everything back.

I also found out that vpype will absolutely not work with arcs – always transform everything into a path before running
optimisations!

I also did the optimisations, then accidentally plotted the unoptimised file. Amazing. Don't think it mattered much,
though I do wonder if the circle jitters in the plot are due to hardware limitations.

Font in use is EMS Readability, because it came closest to a Normschrift – for future reference when modifying the date.
